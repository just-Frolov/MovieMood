# Movie Mood

Introducing 'MovieMood': my personal pet project crafted to explore and learn new technologies. Created as a testing ground, this project serves as a platform for experimenting with different stacks and architectures. Its sole purpose is to push the boundaries of technology while remaining a sandbox for innovation and growth.

Architecture - VIPER.

Libraries - Swiftgen, Alamofire, Lottie.
